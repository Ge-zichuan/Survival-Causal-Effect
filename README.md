# Survival-Causal-Effect
Code and data of paper "Causal Effect Estimation in Survival Analysis with High Dimensional Confounders"

1. Running main.m to estimate the parameters $\beta$ and $\rho$.
2. The first case of simulation 1, first case of simulation 3, all cases of simulation 4, and simulation 5 are uploaded under folder `Numerical Result`.
3. The settings of the rest simulations are uploaded as .txt file due to file size limitation. Each file inludes the settings, in orders, as follows:
   * Dimesion of predictor $X$
   * Number of factors
   * Dimension $d$
   * Samplesize
   * Type of factor generation
   * Type of $\beta$
   * Type of survival model of group 1
   * Type of survival model of group 0
   * Type of censoring generation
   * Censoring rate
