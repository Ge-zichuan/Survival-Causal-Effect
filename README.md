# Survival-Causal-Effect
Code and data of paper "Causal Effect Estimation in Survival Analysis with High Dimensional Confounders"

1. Running main.m to estimate the parameters $\beta$ and $\rho$.
2. The first case of simulation 1 is uploaded under folder `Numerical Result`, with ID number 135.
3. The settings of the rest simulations are uploaded as .txt file. Each file inludes the settings, in orders, as follows:
   * Dimesion of predictor $X$
   * Number of factors
   * Dimension $d$
   * Samplesize         ; F    ;beta  ;t1    ;t0    ;censoring;censoring rate
